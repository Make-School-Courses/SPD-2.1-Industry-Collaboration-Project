# SPD 2.1 Industry Collaboration Project 1

## Course Description

Students team up to work on an ambitious project of their choice or with actual organizations or other student teams to co-develop software products. This experience simulates many challenges and opportunities of actual work environments including, managing stakeholders, cross team collaboration, leading teams, managing up, conflict resolution, advocating for their ideas, increasing probability of adoption within an organization and users. Key concepts of how to lead and how to follow, how to manage and how to be managed are taught through role playing, discussion, and and in depth reading list of both current and classical writings on leadership. For students who never want a job as a manager to those who want to climb the corporate ladder, the course provides vital lessons on how teams work and how to make them great.

Students can find an organization to work with on their own or select from a group of preselected organizations. Students also have the option to work on their own original idea.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
