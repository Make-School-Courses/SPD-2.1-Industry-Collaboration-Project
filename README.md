# SPD-2.1-Industry-Collaboration-Project

## Course Description

Student groups of 5-8 will work with actual organizations to co-develop software products. This experience simulates many challenges and opportunities of actual work environments (See Benefits & New Experiences). The project also creates potential for students to ship products to actual users and develop code that will be used by future developers.

Students can find an organization to work with on their own or select from a group of preselected organizations. Students also have the option to work on their own original idea.
